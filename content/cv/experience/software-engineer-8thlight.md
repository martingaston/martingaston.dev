- Maintained a 30-year-old full-stack ticket ordering system with a leading international distributor, adding features where necessary and preserving functionality while systems were transitioned to a partially-implemented rewrite. Backend code was primarily written in Java and PHP, used MySQL databases, and consumed numerous legacy internal APIs owned by multiple distrubted teams. Our frontend included bespoke JavaScript libraries alongside ample jQuery, with undocumented business logic being rewritten into modern React components when necessary.
- Refined and introduced new business processes with clients, evangelised trunk-based development and incorporated DevOps culture and CI/CD with Jenkins and GitLab. Feedback frequency, build time and onboarding process increased as a result, enabling new staff to become productive in under a week, as opposed to a month.
