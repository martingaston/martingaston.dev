Consulting on modern software development, helping clients write better code.

- Implemented a SaaS product for the digital ventures arm of one of the world's leading reinsurers as part of a 6-month MVP build. Our small, distributed team used Kotlin and Spring Boot to encapsulate the complex domain of insurance into a secure, scalable and extensible REST API for clients and partners.
- Led a client-facing data ingestion API project, serving hundreds of thousands of production requests a day. Scaled application for a 20% increase in server load with an AWS-based serverless stack using Lambda, S3 and API Gateway. Loaded and transformed the data payloads into a Snowflake data warehouse via Airflow.
- Developed a frontend consumer for demoing APIs to clients, built using TypeScript and React. Progressed from a wireframe design into a suite of user-focused UI components, built on top of Material UI, covering the main user interactions and integrating with Storybook.
- Created highly available AWS infrastructure, centering around ECS, Aurora RDS and API Gateway. Managed infrastructure code with Terraform, containerised services in Docker and ensured a swift, automated deployment process with a GitLab CI/CD pipeline.
- Managed and mentored junior staff along 8th Lightâ€™s internal curriculum, focussed primarily on systems design and a solid understanding of imperative, object-oriented and functional paradigms with multiple languages, typically Java, Python, JavaScript, Java and Elixir.
