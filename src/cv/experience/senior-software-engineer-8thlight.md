Consulting on modern software development, helping clients write better code.

- Implemented a SaaS product for the digital ventures arm of one of the world's leading reinsurers as part of a 6-month MVP build. Our small, distributed team used Kotlin and Spring Boot to encapsulate the complex domain of insurance into a secure, scalable and extensible REST API to create a convienient product for clients and partners.
- Developed a frontend consumer for demoing the API to clients, built using TypeScript and React. Progressed from a wireframe design into a suite of user-focused UI components, built on top of Material UI, covering the main user interactions. Ensured the library remained relevant and accessible to future project developers with an extensible API and integration with Storybook.
- Created highly available AWS infrastructure, centering around ECS, Aurora RDS and API Gateway. Managed infrastructure code with Terraform, containerised the application in Docker and ensured a swift, automated deployment process with a GitLab CI/CD pipeline.
- Managed and mentored junior staff along 8th Lightâ€™s internal curriculum, focussed primarily on systems design and a solid understanding of imperative, object-oriented and functional paradigms with multiple languages, typically Java, Python, JavaScript, Java and Elixir.
